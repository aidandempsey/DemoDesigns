The test plan table format includes
row 1: input signal names
row 2: output signal names
row 3: signal radix
row 4: column headings TestNo, delay and Note
column 2: TestNo test number (integer)
column 3: delay

For reference, output all input signal names and all output signal names, as a Verilog comment.

Create and output a single Verilog initial stim_p, in a formatted code box, including the following, for each TestNo row:
Integer signal TestNo with value taken from table column 2
Note field, as a Verilog comment
Assignment of every input signal, irrespective of its value, using the signal radix format defined in table row 3. Do not omit any input signal assignents.
A delay statement, format '# (delay * period);', where delay is an integer or real value, never 0, placing the delay statement after all of the signal stimulus for the TestNo have been assigned, and always including brackets around the delay * statement.
Comparison of every output (not input) signal with the value included in its corresponding output signal column (not the Note column), outputting a warning message (including TestNo) if the values do not match.

Do not include any Verilog loops in the output.
Do not assign any output signals.
Do not include 'case TestNo' in the output.
Do not include any other delay statements.
Do not request that I '-- Continue with the remaining test cases...'. Please output code for all of the tests.
Do not request that I '-- Repeat similar sections for the remaining tests...'. Please output code for all of the tests.
Do not request that I '-- Comparison of output signals with expected values...'. Please output code for all of the tests.
Do not request that I '-- Continue similar sections for the remaining tests...'. Please output code for all of the tests.
