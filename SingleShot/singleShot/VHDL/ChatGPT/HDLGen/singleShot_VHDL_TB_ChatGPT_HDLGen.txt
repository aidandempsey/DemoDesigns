In the table,
Input signal names are included in row 1, output signal names are included in row 2, and signal radix is included in row 3.
Create a single VHDL process stim_p, in a formatted code box, starting at row 4, and including the following
TestNo
Comment in the Note column
Assignment of every input signal, irrespective of its value. Do not assign any output signals.
wait for (delay  * period); statement, after all signal stimulus for the row have been assigned, using delay value in the delay column, with brackets () around (delay * period).
Test if each output signal value (though not input signal values) matches the value included in its corresponding row, outputting a fail message if it does not match.
