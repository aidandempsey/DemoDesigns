In the table, input signal names are included in row 2, output signal names are included in row 3, and signal radix is included in row 4.

Create a single VHDL process stim_p, in a formatted code box, starting at row 5, and including the following 
TestNo
Comment in the Note column
Assignment of each input signal. Do not assign any output signals.
wait for (delay  * period); statement, with brackets as indicated, after all signal stimulus for the row have been assigned.
Test if each output signal value matches the value included in the row, outputting a fail message if it does not match.

signal testNo: integer;
signal period: time := 20 ns;
